1. A description of the scenario your project is operating in.

   I will be creating a real-time chat-room application. Users will sign in with Google. The home screen will show a log-in button, once logged in, the chat-room will display. Firebase will collect and store data including userIDs, messages, and timestamp. 

2. A description of what problem your project seeks to solve.
   
   My project may display problems accessing methods to login, as well as using the Google sign-in method. Another problem that could occur, is limiting how many people can join the chat-room, and how long the data collected will be stored, and how much of the data will be stored.

5. A description of what the technical components of your project will be, including: the routes, the data models, any external data sources you'll use, etc.
   
   Routes: signup, login, logout, messages, users
   Data Models: user model, message model
   External Data Sources:
     Firebase Authentication for user sign up, login, and logout,
     Firestore for storing messages, and users,
     Google login
   React for FrontEnd Components

7. Clear and direct call-outs of how you will meet the various project requirements.
   Firebase will be used to authenticate users when they sign-up and login, creating a secured chat-room application. I will provide error messaging to users when there is an unexpected or invalid error.I will document and testing to ensure the function of the application.

9. A timeline for what project components you plan to complete, week by week, for the remainder of the class.
   This Week:
     Create Firebase project,
